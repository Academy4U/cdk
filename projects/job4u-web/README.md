This example demonstrates how you can setup NorthStar in a React application created by [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html).  

To run the example, just install it and run:

```
npm install
npm start
```

"scripts": {
    "start": "serve -s build", // "react-scripts --max_old_space_size=2048 start",
    "build": "react-scripts --max_old_space_size=4096 build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject", 
  },
